# Sql-Data-Warehouse-Project
This project involved building a SQL data warehouse using the Medallion architecture—comprising the Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
Data from two source systems (ERP and CRM), provided as CSV files, were ingested into a SQL Server database. The data were cleansed, standardized, normalized, and modelled into a star schema to ensure simplicity, flexibility, and optimization for reporting.
